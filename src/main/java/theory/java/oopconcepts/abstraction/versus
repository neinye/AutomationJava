The interface is like a contract with the class, which says 'I only accept stuff, which looks like the signature I
provide'. The class implements the interface by saying 'sure, I will make sure that I look like that'.
So, the interface is kind of a prototype, there are only signatures of methods, which have no implementation, they
have no behaviour of their own.

An abstract class, on the other hand, is like any other class. Being similar to an interface, they, however, can have
some implementation for the methods along with abstract methods (which have no implementation) These methods may
(or may not) have a behaviour and can be overriden in the class that extends the abstract class.

! If the abstract class contains an abstract method, that method SHOULD be implemented by the class which extends it
